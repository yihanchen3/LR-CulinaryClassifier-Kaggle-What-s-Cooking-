# Logistic Regression-Based Cuisine Prediction(Kaggle What's Cooking)

CulinaryClassifier-LR is a machine learning project that predicts the cuisine of a dish based on its ingredients using Logistic Regression and NLP.

The model leverages TF-IDF for feature extraction, allowing it to classify dishes into one of 20 global cuisines.

## Dataset

- **Source**: Kaggle "What's Cooking?" dataset `train.json` & `test.json` (https://www.kaggle.com/c/whats-cooking)
- **Size**: ~40,000 recipes, covering 20 cuisines.

## Methodology

1. **Data Preprocessing**: Tokenization and TF-IDF vectorization of ingredients.
2. **Model Training**: Logistic Regression with GridSearchCV for parameter tuning.
3. **Evaluation**: Achieved 78.8% accuracy on the test set.
4. **Feature Analysis**: Identification of key ingredients per cuisine.

## Usage

1. **Install dependencies with: `pip install pandas numpy nltk scikit-learn plotly plotly-orca psutil`**
2. **Train and Test Model**: Run `whatscooking.py` to preprocess data, train the model on train set, and classify new recipes on test set. For quickly submitting the model results.
3. **Train Model and Visualize Result**: Run `main.ipynb` to train the model and analyze results. Including whole model training and more visualization code using ploty.
